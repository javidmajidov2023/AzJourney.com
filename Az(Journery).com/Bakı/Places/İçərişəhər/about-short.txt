Icherishehir or Old City is the historical core of Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan. The Old City, which was accepted as a World Heritage Site along with the Palace of the Shirvanshahs and the Maiden Tower at the 24th session of UNESCO's World Heritage Committee in Cairns, Australia, in 2000, is the first structure from Azerbaijan to be included in the list.
