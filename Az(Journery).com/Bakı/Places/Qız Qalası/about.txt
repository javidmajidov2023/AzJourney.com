The castle is a defensive historical monument located in the southeastern part of the ancient castle walls, near the seaside park (boulevard). 
There are many unsolved historical-architectural problems of this rare tower-shaped monument. Its height is 28 m, its diameter is 16.5 m on the first floor. 
The thickness of the wall on the first floor reaches 5 m. The interior of the castle is divided into 8 floors. Each floor is built with hewn stones and covered with 
a dome-shaped ceiling. The castle has been functioning as a museum since 1964, and in 2000 it was included in the UNESCO World Heritage List.
These stone ceilings have circular holes in the middle. The holes are in the direction of the vertical line. So, looking through the circular hole in the middle 
of the ceiling of the VIII floor, it is possible to see the floor of the first floor. The only entrance to the fort is on its western side, 
an arched doorway 2 m high and 1.1 m wide above the previous surface.
